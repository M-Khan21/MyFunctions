These functions are learned as examples of variadiac funcitons in C
I had to learn variadiac functions when dealing with the 42 ft_printf project

variadiac fuctions are used to define functions in a way that allows it to take as many arguments as
needed with specifying the the no. of arguments

See notes for more information
